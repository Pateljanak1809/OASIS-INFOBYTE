"This repository contains a login authentication page implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page provides a simple yet effective user authentication experience, allowing users to securely log in using their credentials. It includes features such as input validation for username and password fields, responsive design for various screen sizes, and error handling to provide feedback to users during login attempts. The JavaScript functionality handles authentication logic securely, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring a smooth user experience. This project serves as a practical example of implementing client-side authentication in web development, leveraging front-end technologies to create a functional and user-friendly login interface. Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your needs or use it as a learning resource for building secure login systems."
